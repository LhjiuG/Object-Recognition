# Object-Recognition
Yolo object detector with Tensorflow.

## Introduction
This repo is currently really unorganised, the reason being because when I first started it, I did not know how to use git, but now I do and I plan to reorganise it soon. The object detector is also not completed but I can still use it to show you what I have learned from it already.

## What have I learned?
### Data Manipulation
* Extensive use of python generator.
* Tensorflow dataset API with TFRecord format.
* Image conversion.
* Extensive manipulation with Numpy array and its equivalent from Tensorflow.
* Use of class and class dunder methods.
### TensorFlow
* Use of Keras functionnal API.
* Use of Tensorflow custom layers.
* Use of Tensorflow custom function via tf.function wrapper.
* Tensor manipulation.
* Lot of new Tensorflow methods/functions.
* Custom training loop.
* Better understanding of how work Tensorflow in the background.
### Others
I won't start to enumerate everything that I have learned from this project, but what I can say is that it has deepened my understanding of not only Tensorflow concept but also of Python and Machine learning in general. The astronomical amount of problems that I have encountered forced me to learn so much and I can't wait to learn more.

## What next?
I am not actively working on the project, but before I restart it, I am gonna have to do a lot of refactoring of the code and organise the repo.
