# Object-Recognition
My goal is to create an object detector for a video game.
Because the main goal of this project is to help me learn,
I made sure to understand everything I took inspiration from
and build the most things I could from scratch.

I have not finished it yet and some part might not work flawlessly, but I thought it still might be good to showcase what I have managed up to now.
